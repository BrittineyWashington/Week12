//Coding Steps:
// Create a full CRUD application of your choice using an API or JSON Server.
// Use JQuery/AJAX to interact with the API. 
// Use a form to post new entities.
// Build a way for users to update or delete entities.
// Include a way to get entities from the API.
// Use Bootstrap and CSS to style your project.

//This is my Week 12 Final Unit Project JS File
//Song Manager
// console.log("Hello World... Song Manager is my Week 12 Project!");

//this function takes a songGroup object and POSTs that into the API using ajax
function createSongGroup(songGroup) {
    console.log("createSongGroup songGroup: ", songGroup);//this logs the songGroup object to be POSTED
}
