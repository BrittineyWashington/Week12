# Week 12

Coding Steps:
Create a full CRUD application of your choice using an API or JSON Server.
Use JQuery/AJAX to interact with the API. 
Use a form to post new entities.
Build a way for users to update or delete entities.
Include a way to get entities from the API.
Use Bootstrap and CSS to style your project.
